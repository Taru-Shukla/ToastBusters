# ToastBusters

The goal for this project is to provide a solution that will be particularly helpful for those who would like to use ingredients they already have at home, but struggle with finding recipes that fit their dietary requirements and tastes. Additionally, it can be difficult to accommodate personal preferences and dietary restrictions while also efficiently buying groceries for chosen recipes. We are also aware of the issues of food waste and environmental impact caused by unused or expired ingredients. As a result, we aim to design and implement a software application that will help users plan meals, discover recipes that utilize their available ingredients, and streamline the grocery shopping process, ultimately promoting healthy, enjoyable, and sustainable home cooking.
