## The Why Behind the Technologies Used

### Technology Stack:
- **Java**: We chose Java as it's a robust, high-level object-oriented programming language known for its versatility and compatibility. It is highly suitable for building a complex application like ToastBusters, as it can easily handle tasks ranging from managing user input data to running intricate algorithms for recipe suggestions.
- **JavaFx**: JavaFX is a great choice for creating a rich, immersive GUI. It provides the tools necessary to create a sleek, responsive user interface that's also scalable and easy to maintain.
- **SQL**: A SQL database is used for data persistence, allowing us to store, retrieve, and manipulate user data and recipes effectively. It's reliable, efficient, and well-suited to handle complex queries, which are integral to our application's functionality.
  
Together, these technologies provide a robust and scalable base for ToastBusters, capable of handling the app's needs now and in the future. We aim to continue refining and expanding the application, making the cooking process enjoyable, efficient, and personalized for our users.
